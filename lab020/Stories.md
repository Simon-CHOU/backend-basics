# User Stories - OSS-like File Platform

## Epic: File Upload and Download Platform

### Story 1: Single File Upload (Priority: High)
**As a** user  
**I want to** upload a single file through an API  
**So that** I can store my file securely and get a unique document ID for future reference  

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] File is stored in organized directory structure under D:\dev\FilePlatform\data
- [ ] API returns 201 status with documentId on success
- [ ] API returns appropriate error codes for validation failures

**Dependencies:** Database schema, file storage structure

### Story 2: Large File Sharded Upload (Priority: High)
**As a** user  
**I want to** upload large files in chunks/shards  
**So that** I can reliably upload large files without timeout issues  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] API endpoint accepts file chunks with metadata (chunk number, total chunks, file hash)
- [ ] Each chunk is validated and temporarily stored
- [ ] System tracks upload progress and missing chunks
- [ ] File is reassembled when all chunks are received
- [ ] Reassembled file integrity is verified using hash
- [ ] Complete file is encrypted and stored
- [ ] Unique documentId is generated and returned
- [ ] Temporary chunks are cleaned up after successful assembly
- [ ] API handles concurrent chunk uploads
- [ ] API supports resume functionality for failed uploads

**Dependencies:** Single file upload, chunk management system

### Story 3: File Download by Document ID (Priority: High)
**As a** user  
**I want to** download a file using its document ID  
**So that** I can retrieve my previously uploaded files  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] API endpoint accepts documentId as parameter
- [ ] System validates documentId exists in database
- [ ] File is decrypted before serving
- [ ] Original filename and content-type are preserved
- [ ] File is streamed efficiently for large files
- [ ] API returns 200 status with file content
- [ ] API returns 404 for non-existent documentId
- [ ] Download is logged for audit purposes

**Dependencies:** File upload functionality, encryption/decryption

---

### Story 4: Database Schema Design (Priority: High)
**As a** developer  
**I want to** have a well-designed database schema  
**So that** file metadata and sharding information are properly stored  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] H2 in-memory database is configured
- [ ] Flyway migration scripts are created
- [ ] File metadata table includes: documentId, originalName, size, contentType, uploadDate, filePath, encryptionKey
- [ ] File chunks table includes: chunkId, documentId, chunkNumber, totalChunks, chunkPath, uploadDate
- [ ] Proper indexes are created for performance
- [ ] Foreign key relationships are established
- [ ] Database schema supports dev/stg/prd environments

**Dependencies:** None (foundational)

---

### Story 5: File Storage Organization (Priority: Medium)
**As a** system administrator  
**I want to** have an organized file storage structure  
**So that** files are efficiently stored and easily manageable  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Base directory is D:\dev\FilePlatform\data
- [ ] Files are organized by date hierarchy (year/month/day)
- [ ] File names are hashed to avoid conflicts
- [ ] Temporary chunk storage area is separate from final storage
- [ ] Directory structure supports easy backup and maintenance
- [ ] Storage paths are configurable per environment

**Dependencies:** Database schema

### Story 6: File Encryption and Security (Priority: Medium)
**As a** security-conscious user  
**I want to** have my files encrypted at rest  
**So that** my data is protected from unauthorized access  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Files are encrypted using AES-256 before storage
- [ ] Unique encryption key per file
- [ ] Encryption keys are securely stored in database
- [ ] Decryption is seamless during download
- [ ] Encryption/decryption performance is optimized
- [ ] Security best practices are followed

**Dependencies:** File storage structure

---

### Story 7: Environment Configuration (Priority: Medium)
**As a** developer  
**I want to** have environment-specific configurations  
**So that** the application works correctly across dev/stg/prd environments  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Application profiles for dev, stg, prd are configured
- [ ] Database connection settings per environment
- [ ] File storage paths per environment
- [ ] Logging levels per environment
- [ ] Security settings per environment
- [ ] Placeholder values for stg/prd configurations

**Dependencies:** Database schema

---

### Story 8: Comprehensive Testing Suite (Priority: High)
**As a** developer  
**I want to** have comprehensive test coverage  
**So that** the application is reliable and maintainable  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Unit tests achieve 100% code coverage
- [ ] Integration tests cover all API endpoints
- [ ] End-to-end tests simulate real user scenarios
- [ ] Tests include positive and negative scenarios
- [ ] Performance tests for large file uploads
- [ ] Security tests for encryption/decryption
- [ ] Tests are automated and run in CI/CD pipeline

**Dependencies:** All implementation stories
